# Patterns

Patterns is an educational iOS app that explores the concept of pattern recognition in the world, from nature to artificial intelligence. The app uses interactive visualizations, hand gesture recognition, and sound classification to help users understand how patterns shape intelligence, technology, and our daily lives.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Uses the camera to detect and visualize hand poses in real time.
- **Neural Network Digit Classifier:** Draw digits with your hand and see how a neural network recognizes them, powered by a CoreML MNIST model.
- **Sound Classification:** Recognizes and classifies sounds using the microphone.
- **Fractals & Randomness:** Visualizes fractals, randomness, and other mathematical patterns interactively.
- **Natural Language:** Explore how language patterns are recognized and analyzed.
